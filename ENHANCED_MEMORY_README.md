# Enhanced Memory Assistant System

## 🚀 Overview

This enhanced assistant system now includes comprehensive memory management and flexible language configuration capabilities, inspired by the patterns shown in LangGraph's memory examples. The system can remember user information across conversations and adapt to any language preference.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Comprehensive Memory Management

The system now includes multiple types of memory:

1. **User Profile Memory**: Stores basic user information (name, location, occupation, family status, etc.)
2. **User Memories**: Specific memories about user preferences, interests, experiences, and goals
3. **Conversation Memories**: Important topics and key points from past conversations
4. **Assistant Instructions**: User-specific instructions for how the assistant should behave

### 🌍 Flexible Language Configuration

Gone are the days of hardcoded Arabic-only responses! The system now supports:

- **Strict Language Enforcement**: Always respond in a specific language regardless of input
- **Flexible Language Matching**: Adapt to the user's input language while preferring a primary language
- **Auto Language Detection**: Automatically choose the best language for each response
- **Cultural Context Awareness**: Consider cultural context when appropriate
- **Translation Assistance**: Offer translations between languages when helpful

### 🔄 Memory Continuity

- **Cross-Thread Memory**: User information persists across different conversation sessions
- **Intelligent Memory Updates**: Uses Trustcall to efficiently update existing memories
- **Memory Prioritization**: Important memories are prioritized and referenced more frequently
- **Contextual Awareness**: Builds on previous conversations and remembers ongoing topics

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Memory Storage

The system uses a hybrid approach:
- **LangGraph Memory Store**: For general user memories and conversation histories
- **Supabase Database**: For specialized data like grocery lists, meal plans, and budgets
- **Runtime Configuration**: Dynamic loading of assistant configurations from database

### Memory Schemas

```python
# User Profile
class UserProfile(BaseModel):
    name: Optional[str]
    location: Optional[str]
    occupation: Optional[str]
    family_status: Optional[str]
    interests: List[str]
    communication_style: Optional[str]

# User Memory
class UserMemory(BaseModel):
    content: str
    category: Literal["personal", "preference", "interest", "experience", "goal"]
    importance: Literal["low", "medium", "high"]
    last_referenced: datetime

# Language Configuration
class AssistantLanguageConfig(BaseModel):
    primary_language: str
    language_enforcement: Literal["strict", "flexible", "auto"]
    fallback_language: str = "english"
    translation_enabled: bool = True
    cultural_context: Optional[str]
```

### Memory Update Decision Logic

The system intelligently decides when to update memory based on:
- Personal information shared (name, location, job, family) → update profile
- Preferences, interests, experiences, goals → save as user memory
- Important conversation topics or requests → save as conversation memory
- User instructions for assistant behavior → update assistant instructions

## 📚 Pre-configured Language Options

### Available Language Configurations

1. **arabic_only**: Strict Arabic-only responses with Middle Eastern cultural context
2. **english_only**: Strict English-only responses
3. **spanish_only**: Strict Spanish-only responses with Latin American cultural context
4. **french_only**: Strict French-only responses with European cultural context
5. **multilingual_flexible**: Flexible language matching with translation support
6. **multilingual_auto**: Automatic language detection and adaptation

### Custom Language Configuration

You can create custom language configurations for any language:

```python
custom_config = AssistantLanguageConfig(
    primary_language="german",
    language_enforcement="strict",
    fallback_language="english",
    cultural_context="europe"
)
```

## 🔧 Setup and Configuration

### Database Configuration

To use language configurations with existing assistants, update the `assistant_config` in your `conversations` table:

```json
{
  "configurable": {
    "language": "spanish",
    "language_config": {
      "primary_language": "spanish",
      "language_enforcement": "flexible",
      "cultural_context": "latin_america",
      "translation_enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Runtime Configuration

Pass language configuration through the configurable parameters:

```python
config = {
    "configurable": {
        "user_id": "user123",
        "thread_id": "conversation456",
        "assistant_id": "assistant789",  # Will load config from database
        "language_config": LANGUAGE_CONFIGS["multilingual_flexible"]
    }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Run the Enhanced Test Suite

```bash
python test_enhanced_memory_assistant.py
```

This comprehensive test suite includes:
- Language configuration testing
- Memory management scenarios
- Conversation continuity tests
- Language flexibility demonstrations
- Interactive demo mode

### Test Scenarios

1. **Memory Collection**: Assistant learns user information over multiple messages
2. **Cross-Thread Continuity**: User information persists across different conversation threads
3. **Preference Learning**: Assistant adapts to user's communication preferences
4. **Language Adaptation**: Demonstrates different language enforcement modes

## 🌟 Example Usage

### Memory Management Example

```python
# User shares personal information
user: "Hi! My name is Alice and I'm a teacher living in Amsterdam."
assistant: "Hello Alice! It's great to meet you. How can I assist you today?"

# Later in a different conversation thread
user: "Can you remind me what you know about me?"
assistant: "Hi Alice! I remember that you're a teacher living in Amsterdam. 
           I also recall that you have two cats named Whiskers and Luna, 
           you love reading and cooking Italian food, and you're learning 
           Spanish for your upcoming trip to Barcelona."
```

### Language Configuration Example

```python
# Arabic Assistant (Strict Mode)
user: "Hello, how are you?"  # English input
assistant: "مرحبا! أنا بخير، شكرا لك. كيف يمكنني مساعدتك اليوم؟"  # Arabic response

# Multilingual Assistant (Flexible Mode)
user: "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"  # Spanish input
assistant: "¡Hola! Estoy muy bien, gracias. ¿En qué puedo ayudarte hoy?"  # Spanish response
```

## 🔄 Migration from Previous System

### Backward Compatibility

The system maintains backward compatibility with existing assistant configurations:
- Old Arabic-only configurations automatically map to the new `arabic_only` language config
- Existing assistant configurations continue to work without changes
- Gradual migration path for adopting new features

### Upgrading Existing Assistants

To upgrade an existing assistant to use the new system:

1. **Update assistant configuration** in the database:
```sql
UPDATE conversations 
SET assistant_config = jsonb_set(
    assistant_config, 
    '{configurable,language_config}', 
    '{"primary_language": "arabic", "language_enforcement": "strict", "cultural_context": "middle_east"}'
)
WHERE assistant_name = 'Ayoub Arabic Assistant';
```

2. **Test the new configuration** using the test suite
3. **Monitor behavior** to ensure language requirements are met
