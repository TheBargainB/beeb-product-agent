# Personal Grocery Assistant - Customer Configuration Guide

## Overview

The Personal Grocery Assistant is an AI-powered agent that provides personalized grocery shopping recommendations based on customer preferences stored in your Supabase database. Each customer gets a tailored experience with their dietary restrictions, preferred stores, budget constraints, and shopping persona.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Multi-Customer Design
- **Single Codebase**: One agent serves multiple customers
- **Runtime Configuration**: Customer preferences loaded dynamically
- **No Hardcoded Data**: All customer info stored in database
- **Scalable**: Can handle thousands of customers

## 🎯 Customer Personas

The assistant supports different shopping personas:

- **🥗 healthHero**: Health-focused, prefers organic and nutritious options
- **🌱 ecoShopper**: Environmentally conscious, sustainable products
- **💊 sensitiveStomach**: Gentle foods, easy digestion
- **💰 budgetSaver**: Price-conscious, looks for deals
- **⚡ convenienceShopper**: Values quick and easy solutions

## 🛠️ Configuration

### 1. Customer Profile Setup

Create a customer profile in your `crm_profiles` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO crm_profiles (
  id,
  full_name,
  preferred_name,
  email,
  preferred_stores,
  shopping_persona,
  dietary_restrictions,
  budget_range,
  shopping_frequency,
  product_interests,
  price_sensitivity,
  communication_style
) VALUES (
  '4c432d3e-0a15-4272-beda-0d327088d5f6',
  'Sarah Johnson',
  'Sarah',
  'sarah.johnson@example.com',
  ARRAY['Albert Heijn', 'Jumbo'],
  'healthHero',
  ARRAY['gluten-free', 'lactose-intolerant'],
  '[80,120]'::numrange,
  'weekly',
  ARRAY['organic foods', 'fresh vegetables', 'lean proteins'],
  'medium',
  'casual'
);
```

### 2. AI Config Template

The grocery assistant uses this AI config template:

```json
{
  "assistant_type": "grocery_assistant",
  "system_prompt": "You are a personal grocery shopping assistant...",
  "use_customer_profile": true,
  "profile_fields": [
    "preferred_stores",
    "dietary_restrictions", 
    "shopping_persona",
    "budget_range",
    "price_sensitivity",
    "product_interests",
    "shopping_frequency"
  ],
  "capabilities": [
    "meal_planning",
    "grocery_list_creation", 
    "budget_optimization",
    "store_recommendations",
    "dietary_compliance"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Runtime Configuration

When creating an assistant instance from your admin panel:

```python
# Configuration passed to the agent
config = {
    "configurable": {
        "customer_profile_id": "4c432d3e-0a15-4272-beda-0d327088d5f6",
        "user_id": "sarah_session_001",
        "thread_id": "grocery_conversation_123"
    }
}

# Invoke the assistant
response = await graph.ainvoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I need healthy breakfast ideas"}]},
    config=config
)
```

## 🤖 How It Works

### 1. Customer Profile Loading
When a conversation starts, the assistant:
- Extracts `customer_profile_id` from the runtime config
- Loads customer preferences from the database
- Formats personalized context for the AI

### 2. Personalized Responses
The assistant considers:
- **Dietary restrictions**: Suggests gluten-free options for Sarah
- **Preferred stores**: Recommends Albert Heijn and Jumbo
- **Shopping persona**: Focuses on healthy, organic options
- **Budget constraints**: Stays within €80-120 range
- **Communication style**: Uses casual, friendly tone

### 3. Memory Integration
The assistant remembers:
- Previous grocery lists and shopping patterns
- Meal plans and recipe preferences
- Budget tracking and spending habits
- Product likes and dislikes

## 💡 Example Interactions

### Scenario 1: Breakfast Recommendations
**User**: "I need healthy breakfast ideas"

**Assistant Response** (considers Sarah's profile):
```
Hi Sarah! 🌅 Since you're focused on healthy eating and have gluten-free and lactose-intolerant restrictions, here are some great breakfast ideas:

🥣 **Gluten-Free Options:**
• Gluten-free oatmeal with fresh berries (€3.50 at Albert Heijn)
• Rice cakes with almond butter (€4.20 at Jumbo)
• Quinoa breakfast bowl with nuts (€5.80)

🥛 **Lactose-Free Dairy:**
• Oat milk for smoothies (€2.15 at Albert Heijn)

💰 **Budget-Friendly**: All options fit within your €80-120 weekly budget!

Would you like me to create a shopping list for these items? I can check prices at both Albert Heijn and Jumbo for you! 🛒
```

### Scenario 2: Meal Planning
**User**: "Plan my meals for this week"

**Assistant Response** (considers preferences and budget):
```
Perfect! Let me create a healthy meal plan for you, Sarah! 🍽️

**Monday:**

## 📊 Admin Panel Integration

### Customer Creation Flow
1. **Create Customer Profile**: Add customer to `crm_profiles` table
2. **Set Preferences**: Configure dietary restrictions, stores, persona
3. **Generate Assistant**: Create assistant instance with profile ID
4. **Runtime Config**: Pass `customer_profile_id` in configurable parameters

### Example Admin Panel Code
```python
# Create new customer assistant
def create_customer_assistant(customer_data):
    # 1. Create CRM profile
    profile_id = create_crm_profile(customer_data)
    
    # 2. Create assistant configuration
    config = {
        "configurable": {
            "customer_profile_id": profile_id,
            "user_id": customer_data["user_id"],
            "thread_id": f"session_{profile_id[:8]}"
        }
    }
    
    # 3. Initialize assistant
    return initialize_grocery_assistant(config)

# Update customer preferences
def update_customer_preferences(profile_id, updates):
    # Update CRM profile in database
    update_crm_profile(profile_id, updates)
    
    # Assistant automatically picks up changes on next conversation
    return {"status": "preferences_updated"}
```
